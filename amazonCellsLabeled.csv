This is by far the worst purchase I've made on Amazon.,0
Excellent starter wireless headset.,0
It is a joy to use.,1
Trying to make a call on these is an exercise in frustration.,0
Just reading on the specs alone makes you say WOW.,1
This product had a strong rubber/petroleum smell that was unbearable after a while and caused me to return it,0
It has been a winner for us.,1
The nokia CA-42 USB cable did not work with my phone.,0
I would highly recommend this product.,1
The sound quality is good and functionality is awesome.,1
Linksys should have some way to exchange a bad phone for a refurb unit or something!,0
THAT one didn't work either.,0
Nice headphones for the price and they work great!,1
AMAZON SUCKS.,0
Logitech Bluetooth Headset is a 10!.,1
Excellent sound quality.,1
Nice Sound.,1
Motorola finally got the voice quality of a bluetooth headset right.,1
Also difficult to put on.I'd recommend avoiding this product.,0
I used to talk on it for 1 - 1 1/2 hours and the battery would be literally drained and dying.,0
disappointing.,0
Not good enough for the price.,0
Integrated seamlessly with the Motorola RAZR phone.,1
Great for using with your home stereo.,1
You get what you pay for I guess.,0
Good product - incredible value.,1
I came over from Verizon because cingulair has nicer cell phones.... the first thing I noticed was the really bad service.,0
Stay Away From the Q!.,0
Does Not Work.,0
I have tried these cables with my computer and my iPod and it works just fine.,1
very disappointed.,0
Horrible phone.,0
It looses connection to the phone even when it is within a couple feet between the two.,0
2 thumbs up to this seller,1
This is a great little item.,1
Also the area where my unit broke).- I'm not too fond of the magnetic strap.,0
It's very convenient and simple to use - gets job done & makes the car ride so much smoother.,1
Do Not Buy for D807...wrongly advertised for D807.,0
Soyo technology sucks.,0
Worked great!.,1
Makes it easier to keep up with my bluetooth when I'm not wearing it.,0
Adapter does not provide enough charging current.,0
It has kept up very well.,1
I am very happy,1
worthless product.,0
Poor Talk Time Performance.,0
Who in their right mind is gonna buy this battery?.,0
Made very sturdy.,1
Great bluetooth!.,1
Would recommend this item.,1
I have been very satisfied with this cell phone from day one.,1
Mobile Phone Tools are a must have.,1
Disappointment.. I hate anything that goes in my ear.,0
Its the best headset I have used.,1
Its well-designed and very sharp -- the blue is a very nice color.,1
Don't buy it.,0
Nice solid keyboard.,1
Don't buy this product.,0
How stupid is that?,0
Awkward to use and unreliable.,0
I am going to have to be the first to negatively review this product.,0
The screen does get smudged easily because it touches your ear and face.,0
Improper description.... I had to return it.,0
It does everything the description said it would.,1
My 5-year old Nokia 2160 from Tracfone holds the charge a lot better than this.,0
Works great.,1
Only had this a month but it's worked flawlessly so far.,1
Best I've found so far .... I've tried 2 other bluetooths and this one has the best quality (for both me and the listener) as well as ease of using.,1
what a disappointment,0
Great Product.,1
These headphones were a great find - and I think they are perhaps the best purchase I've made in the last several years - seriously.,1
I does not maintain a connection with the computer while it is on my lap.,0
Does everything it should and more.,1
The accompanied software is almost brilliant.,1
wont work right or atleast for me.,0
I had to purchase a different case.,0
I exchanged the sony ericson z500a for this and I'm pretty happy with that decision.,1
This battery is an excellent bargain!,1
They refuse to refund or replace.,0
Very good quality though,1
Do not make the same mistake as me.,0
"I can barely ever hear on it and am constantly saying ""what?""",0
WORST PHONE EVER.,0
Works as described.,1
I'm a bit disappointed.,0
none of the new ones have ever quite worked properly.,0
Any ring tone..Overall good phone to buy..,1
The company shipped my product very promptly and it works well.,1
Love this product.,1
Returned 8 hours later.,0
doesn't last long.,0
Love this headset!,1
Will order from them again!,1
Poor Construction.,0
This is so embarassing and also my ears hurt if I try to push the ear plug into my ear.,0
Doesn't do the job.,0
The pairing of the two devices was so easy it barely took a couple minutes before I started making calls with the voice dialing feature.,1
I was able to do voice dialing in the car with no problem.,1
This is a great deal.,1
The phone loads super!,1
Product is exactly as described.,1
Waste of money.,0
The headsets are easy to use and everyone loves them.,1
Disappointed!.,0
Bad Purchase.,0
.... Item arrived quickly and works great with my Metro PCS Samsung SCH-r450 slider phone and Sony Premium Sound in ear plugs.,1
Nice docking station for home or work.,1

It was a waste of my money.,0
It definitely was not as good as my S11.,1
What a waste.,0
Good audio quality.,1
VERY DISAPPOINTED.,0
Very easy to use.,1
Lousy product.,0
I've also had problems with the phone reading the memory card in which I always turn it on and then off again.,0
The instructions didn't explain that a microphone jack could be used.,0
We are sending it back.,0
Plug was the wrong size.,0
And the sound quality is great.,1
It defeats the purpose of a bluetooth headset.,0
I love this bluetooth!,1
People couldnt hear me talk and I had to pull out the earphone and talk on the phone.,0
The first thing that happened was that the tracking was off.,0
Iam very pleased with my purchase.,1
Kind of flops around.,0
Protects the phone on all sides.,1
I love this device.,1
Big Disappointment with calendar sync.,0
Phone now holds charge like it did when it was new.,1
Tied to charger for conversations lasting more than 45 minutes.MAJOR PROBLEMS!!,0
Doesn't Work.,0
The sound quality is excellent as well.,1
I wouldn't recommend buying this product.,0
I want my money back.,0
I kept catching the cable on the seat and I had to pull the phone out to turn it on an off.,0
I was amazed at the quick arrival of the two original lg cell phone batteries and and at a fraction of the price.,1
Not nearly as good looking as the AMAZON picture makes it look.,0
I am not impressed with this and i would not recommend this item to anyone.,0
I've missed numerous calls because of this reason.,0
The ear buds only play music in one ear.,0
don't waste your money and time.,0
Item Does Not Match Picture.,0
Case was more or less an extra that I originally put on but later discarded because it scratched my ear.,0
It was that loud.Glad to say that the Plantronics 510 maintains a flawless connection to my cell and with no static during normal use.,1
Great charger.,1
Great product.,1
Buy a different phone - but not this.,0
Now I know that I made a wise decision.,1
There's really nothing bad I can say about this headset.,0
Clear crisp sound.,1
I highly recommend this modest priced cellular phone.,1
Everything worked on the first try.The device was certainly engineered in a clever way and the construction feels good.,1
Awsome Device Works Great!!.,1
This device is great in several situations:1.),1
This is simply the BEST bluetooth headset for sound quality!,1
Piece of trash.,0
Battery life is also great!,1
Their Research and Development division obviously knows what they're doing.,1
My Sanyo has survived dozens of drops on blacktop without ill effect.,1
The design might be ergonomic in theory but I could not stand having these in my ear.,0
awesome device.,1
I can't use this case because the smell is disgusting.,0
I purcashed this for the car charger and it does not work.,0
Those phones are working just fine now.,1
Oh and I forgot to also mention the weird color effect it has on your phone.,0
Not impressed.,0
I wear it everyday and it holds up very well.,1
"Looks great and is strong.""",1
And I just love the colors!,1
good protection and does not make phone too bulky.,1
Not a good bargain.,0
The plug did not work very well.,0
This is hands down the best phone I've ever had.,1
Worked very well paired with a Treo 700w and as a Skype headset on my PC (using a USB Bluetooth transceiver).,1
I don't like this Nokia either.,0
Great Value.,1
Excellent product for the price.,1
Battery lasts only a few hours.,0
The best electronics of the available FM Transmitters.,1
Car charger as well as AC charger are included to make sure you never run out of juice.Highy recommended,1
The item received was Counterfeit.,0
Krussel Always good.,1
I did not have any problem with this item and would order it again if needed.,1
I was looking for this headset for a long time and now that I've got it I couldn't be happier.,1

much better than the hard plastic cases.,1
It also had a new problem.,0
Does not fit.,0
Disapointing Results.,0
What a waste of money and time!.,0
Not good when wearing a hat or sunglasses.,0
The phone is sturdy and waterproof.,1
This phone works great.,1
Very wind-resistant.,1
Painful on the ear.,0
It only recognizes the Phone as its storage device.,0
Problem is that the ear loops are made of weak material and break easily.,0
Fantastic buy and will get again for whatever my next phone is,1
W810i is just SUPERB.,1
For the price this was a great deal.,1
No real improvement.,0
I'm returning them.,0

This case seems well made.,1
Easy to use.,1
It is so small and you don't even realize that it is there after a while of getting used to it.,1
Cumbersome design.,0
You have to hold the phone at a particular angle for the other party to hear you clearly.,0

The battery life is highly unacceptable.,0
Magical Help.,1
cool phone.,1
#1 It Works - #2 It is Comfortable.,1
Excellent wallet type phone case.,1
Plan on ordering from them again and again.,1

Leopard Print is wonderfully wild!.,1
Price is good too.,1
EXCELLENT SERVICE!!!!!!!!.,1
The best phone in market :).,1
This phone tries very hard to do everything but fails at it's very ability to be a phone.,0
I have yet to run this new battery below two bars and that's three days without charging.,1
Would not reccommend.,0
Thank you for wasting my money.,0
I'll be looking for a new earpiece.,0
Easy to pair with my Samsung Cell.,1
And none of the tones is acceptable.,0
I found this product to be waaay too big.,0
Mic Doesn't work.,0
Works great!.,1
It always cuts out and makes a beep beep beep sound then says signal failed.,0
You need at least 3 mins to get to your phone book from the time you first turn on the phone.Battery life is short.,0
Worst software ever used.... If I could give this zero stars I would.,0
Can't store anything but phone numbers to SIM.,0
Very Dissapointing Performance.,0
Great product for the price!.,1
I received my headset in good time and was happy with it.,1
I ordered this for sony Ericsson W810i but I think it only worked once (thats when I first used it).,0
This particular model would not work with my Motorola Q smartphone.,0
The Jabra EarGels fit my ears very well.,1
The text messaging feature is really tricky to use.,0
Reversible plug works great.,1
Save your money.... I've had this item for 11 months now.,0
WORTHWHILE.,1
Everything about this product is wrong.First,0
You need two hands to operate the screen.This software interface is decade old and cannot compete with new software designs.,0
"jabra ear gels ""R"" the best!.",1
Unfortunately it did not work.,0
Freezes frequently4.,0
camera color balance is AWFUL.,0
The plastic breaks really easy on this clip.,0
It makes very strange ticking noises before it ends the call.,0
I received it quickly and it works great!!,1
It was quite comfortable in the ear.,1
The construction of the headsets is poor.,0
I highly recommend this case.,1
Great Phone.,1
Great audio!.,1
Very good stuff for the price.,1
An Awesome New Look For Fall 2000!.,1
its a little geeky but i think thats its sex on toast and it rocks and oozes sex right down to its battery embedded sleek stylish leather case.,1
I'd like to return it.,0
I received my supposedly new motorola 375 and apparently there was not a match between the phone and the charger.,0
So I bought about 10 of these and saved alot of money.,1
the charger worked for about a week and then completely stopped charging my phone.,0
"You get extra minutes so that you can carry out the call and not get cut off.""",1
Battery is holding up well.,1
Used and dirty.,0
Highly recommend for any one who has a blue tooth phone.,1
Plantronics Bluetooth Excelent Buy.,1
Not loud enough and doesn't turn on like it should.,0
Disappointed with battery.,0
Good transmit audio.,1
Best headset ever!!!.,1
The reception has been generally good.,1
The keyboard is really worthwhile in usefulness and is sturdy enough I don't expect any problems.,1
There's a horrible tick sound in the background on all my calls that I have never experienced before.,0
I have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful.,1
WARNING - DO NOT BUY!!.,0
It's kind of embarrassing to use because of how it looks and mostly it's embarrassing how child-like the company is.,0
Works well.,1
You can't beat the price on these.,1
We have gotten a lot of compliments on it.,1
After a year the battery went completely dead on my headset.,0
Utter crap.. Sound quality is TERRIBLE.,0
It clicks into place in a way that makes you wonder how long that mechanism would last.,0
This is a great product..... sure beats using your fingers!.,1
It's uncomfortable and the sound quality is quite poor compared with the phone (Razr) or with my previous wired headset (that plugged into an LG).,0
The only good thing was that it fits comfortably on small ears.,1
Timely shipment and quality product.,1
It is simple to use and I like it.,1
Worst ever.,0
Unfortunately the ability to actually know you are receiving a call is a rather important feature and this phone is pitiful in that respect.,0
It finds my cell phone right away when I enter the car.,1
Very Displeased.,0
The eargels channel the sound directly into your ear and seem to increase the sound volume and clarity.,1
If the two were seperated by a mere 5+ ft I started to notice excessive static and garbled sound from the headset.,0
Has been working great.,1
I didn't think that the instructions provided were helpful to me.,0
I gave it 5 stars because of the sound quality.,1
I love the ringtones because they are so upbeat!,1
Works fine.,1
you could only take 2 videos at a time and the quality was very poor.,0
Great case and price!,1
Does not work for listening to music with the cingular 8125.,0
I love all the features and form factor.,1
It is easy to turn on and off when you are in the car and the volume controls are quite accessable.,1
Absolutely great.,1
Treo and T-Mobile refused to replace it again and forced me to buy another phone without any kind of upgrade discount.,0
This is the first phone I've had that has been so cheaply made.,0
I was very impressed with the price of the cases.,1
Works like a charm.. Works as advertised.,1
What a big waste of time.,0
I checked everywhere and there is no feature for it which is really disappointing.,0
We would recommend these to others.,1
Waste of 13 bucks.,0
Product was excellent and works better than the verizon one and Boy was it cheaper!,1
Unfortunately it's easy to accidentally activate them with the gentle-touch buttons if you accidentally touch the phone to your face while listening.,0
A PIECE OF JUNK THAT BROKE AFTER BEING ON MY PHONE FOR 2 DAYS!!!,0
I purchased this and within 2 days it was no longer working!!!!!!!!!,0
the worst phone from samsung...crap..... this crappy Samsung E715.. is the worst i have ever seeen.,0
One of my favorite purchases ever.,1
1. long lasting battery (you don't have to recharge it as frequentyly as some of the flip phones)2.,0
Excellent Phone.,1
The price was very good and with the free shipping and all it was a good purchase.,1
Comfortable in my hand.,1
Voice recognition is tremendous!,1
Items stated as included from the description ARE NOT INCLUDED.,0
Not as good as I had hoped.,0
Nice design and quality.,1
The voice recognition thru the handset is excellent.,1
So there is no way for me to plug it in here in the US unless I go by a converter.,0
I'm really disappointed all I have now is a charger that doesn't work.,0
Very happy with this product.,1
Having trouble with volume.,0
Thank you for such great service.,1
New Battery works great in phone.,1
This allows the possibility of double booking for the same date and time after the first.,0
In my house I was getting dropped coverage upstairs and no coverage in my basement.,0
I am very impressed with this headset from Plantronics.,1
I bought this phone as a replacement for my StarTac and have regretted it since.,0
I could not recommend these more.,0
This frog phone charm is adorable and very eye catching.,1
It is practically useless and did not add any kind of boost to my reception after I bought it.,0
Still Waiting...... I'm sure this item would work well.. if I ever recieve it!,0
i would advise to not purchase this item it never worked very well.,0
Superb Phone on a Great Network.,1
However I needed some better instructions.,0
It fits my ear well and is comfortable on.,1
Buttons are too small.,0
Very much disappointed with this company.,0
VERY comfortable.,1
Appears to actually outperform the original battery from China that came with my V325i.,1
The worst piece of crap ever along with the Verizon customer service.,0
It worked very well.,1
Keep up the good work Amazon!!,1
This phone is pretty sturdy and I've never had any large problems with it.,1
I wish I could return the unit and get back my money.,0
The battery works great!,1
Good Quality.,1
I am also very happy with the price.,1
Worst Customer Service Ever.,0
The only thing that disappoint me is the infra red port (irda).,0
It's not what it says it is.,0
The BT headset was such a disapoinment.,0
Great for iPODs too.,1
Then a few days later the a puff of smoke came out of the phone while in use.,0
They work about 2 weeks then break.,0
Could not get strong enough signal.,0
All the other cases I've tried normally fall apart after a few months but this one seems to be in for the long haul.,1
I love being able to use one headset for both by land-line and cell.,1
[...] down the drain because of a weak snap!,0
So I basically threw my money out the window for nothing.,0
These are certainly very comfortable and functionality is decent.,1
Same problem as others have mentioned.,0
I love the look and feel of Samsung flipphones.,1
It's A PIECE OF CRAP!,0
Beautiful styling though.,1
I recently had problems where I could not stay connected for more than 10 minutes before being disconnected.,0
Its reception is very very poor.,0
A good quality bargain.. I bought this after I bought a cheapy from Big Lots that sounded awful and people on the other end couldn't hear me.,1
Excellent dual-purpose headset.,1
Don't waste your $$$ on this one.,0
Then I had to continue pairing it periodically since it somehow kept dropping.,0
I used bitpim (a free program you can find on the internet)to transfer data to the phone.The price of the cable was excellent.,1
Battery has no life.,0
Phone falls out easily.,0
Virgin Wireless rocks and so does this cheap little phone!,1
Excellent product for the price.,1
They made this case too small and is very difficult to install.,0
Never got it!!!!!,0
The iGo chargers and tips are really great.,1
The earpiece on this is too large or too heavy...it keeps falling out of my ear.,0
How can that be?The audio quality is poor.,0
Defective crap.,0
im surprised this is a good quality car charger and there's not much reviews about it.,1
Very prompt service.,1
I bought it for my mother and she had a problem with the battery.,0
I would highly recommend this.,1
I would recommend it.,1
Exactly what I wanted.,1
This PDA rocks.,1
The headset fulfills my requirements so I am happy with my purchase.,1
I advise EVERYONE DO NOT BE FOOLED!,0
The sound is clear and the people I talk to on it are amazed at the quality too.,1
I got the aluminum case for my new Palm VX and it worked really well--it has protected my handheld perfectly so far.,1
After trying many many handsfree gadgets this is the one that finally works well.,1
Restored my phone to like new performance.,1
This product is ideal for people like me whose ears are very sensitive.,1
Cheap but hey it works.. Was pleasantly suprised given the low cost of this item.,1
I did not bother contacting the company for few dollar product but I learned the lesson that I should not have bought this form online anyway.,0
It has all the features I want,1
The volume for the ringer is REAL good (you have choices how loud).,1
Someone shouldve invented this sooner.,1
Not a good item.. It worked for a while then started having problems in my auto reverse tape player.,0
I have bought this Nokia cell phone a few weeks ago and it was a nightmare.,0
I had to go to a store and bought a new NOKIA phone which is working great.,1
Chinese Forgeries Abound!.,0
Obviously there is a problem with the adhesive.,0
My sister has one also and she loves it.,1
The replacement died in a few weeks.,0
I Was Hoping for More.,0
Not worth it.,0
IT'S REALLY EASY.,1
I am glad I purchased it.,1
The only thing that I think could improve is the sound leaks out from the headset.,0
The majority of the Logitech earbud headsets failed.,0
A pretty good product.,1
I would recommend this.,1
I even fully charged it before I went to bed and turned off blue tooth and wi-fi and noticed that it only had 20 % left in the morning.,0
The shipping time was also very quick!,1
The one big drawback of the MP3 player is that the buttons on the phone's front cover that let you pause and skip songs lock out after a few seconds.,0
Too bad you have to pay up to $$$ a month for the service!,0
Avoid this one if you can.,0
Reception is terrible and full of static.,0
The commercials are the most misleading.,0
I'm happy about this purchase- good quality and low price.,1
Very pleased with this headset.,1
The battery is unreliable as well as the service use antena.,0
its extremely slow and takes forever to do anything with it.,0
The camera on the phone may be used as a dustpan when indoors... I'd rather be using a disposable then this.,0
It's pretty easy.,1
Authentic leather with nice shine and comfort .I recommend you this case !!,1
My headset works just peachy-keen.,1
This product is very High quality Chinese CRAP!!!!!!,0
Yes it's shiny on front side - and I love it!,1
The keyboard is a nice compromise between a full QWERTY and the basic cell phone number keypad.,1
I usually don't like headbands but this one is very lightweight & doesn't mess up my hair.,1
This is a VERY average phone with bad battery life that operates on a weak network.,0
Very satisifed with that.,1
It dit not work most of the time with my Nokia 5320.,0
lightweight and works well.,1
The phone can also take great pictures and even video clips.,1
Bad Reception.,0
Can't upload ringtones from a third party.,0
If you are Razr owner...you must have this!,1
don't waste your money.,0
A usable keyboard actually turns a PDA into a real-world useful machine instead of just a neat gadget.,1
Phone is sturdy as all nokia bar phones are.,1
They have been around for years and carries the highest quality of anti-glare screen protector that I have found to date.,1
fast service.,1
I bought this to use with my Kindle Fire and absolutely loved it!,1
Everything about it is fine and reasonable for the price i.e.,1
Excellent product.,1
Works good.,1
The mic is great.,1
Think it over when you plan to own this one!This sure is the last MOTO phone for me!,0
So anyone near you will hear part of your conversation.,0
Better than you'd expect.,1
So just beware.,0
Poor product.,0
This fixes all the problems.,1
As I said above....PRETTY USELESS!,0
Were JERKS on the phone.,0
It is very comfortable on the ear.,1
Their network coverage in Los Angeles is horrible.,0
Much less than the jawbone I was going to replace it with.,1
Very good phone.,1
It is unusable in a moving car at freeway speed.,0
I own 2 of these cases and would order another.,1
The Ngage is still lacking in earbuds.,0
Its a total package.,1
I even dropped this phone into a stream and it was submerged for 15 seconds and it still works great!,1
Very well made and fits my Surefire GX2 perfectly.,1
I got it because it was so small and adorable.,1
